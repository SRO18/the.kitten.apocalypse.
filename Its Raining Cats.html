            <h2>Why Cats?</h2>
            <p>
              Cats are one of the most sinister races of creatures ever created.
              While seemingly lovable and cuddly their true colors show in their
              aggression towards humans. Daily attacks disguised as playfulness
              show their real intentions towards us humans. They wish to attack
              us and dominate but we are much larger and we keep them in check
              with fear.

          <div class="container-teal vertical-colors">
            <h2><strong>Their Plan</strong></h2>
            <p>
              Overwhelm the human population with numbers and attack. Forcing us
              into a war where sheer numbers will win ownership of the planet.
              They will force us into concentration camps and enslave us while
              slowly forcing the human race into extinction.

            <h2>How Do We Prevent This</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Control Their Numbers
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Keep your cats nutured or spayed so they cannot reproduce as
                    quickly
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>An unfit cat cannot pose a threat, keep your cat well fed</li>
              <li>
                Minimize their aggressive nature with less "play time" and more
                cuddle time
              </li>
              <li>
                Dont let your cat control you. Dont give into unecessary demands
                for extra food or treats, this is their way of enslaving us to
                do their bidding
              </li>

            <h2>Types Of Cats To Beware</h2>

                The Cuddler
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Seemingly Sweet but truly one of the most horrifying and
                    deadly types of cats
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Watch for unwarrented purring or possible ulterior motives
                    for cuddles
                  </li>
                </ul>

                The Skittish One
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These little terrors are the stuff of nightmares, making you
                    believe they are docile fear driven creatures when they
                    really just wait till youre not looking to claw off your
                    skin and urinate on everything you love.

                The Pairs

                  <li>
                    Cats in pairs are twice as evil. They will plot against you
                    and hour house hold to attack and make you do their bidding
                    with twice the cuteness and twice the "love"

              These homely creatures are a threat to our world as we know it.
              Stay aware of your home and neighborhood cats. If you can
              recognize the signs, you can help prevent their evil plans from
              coming to realization. Everyone must do their part if we are to
              keep these sweet enemies at bay.
